0.5.6 / 2012-06-22

* Enhancements

  * Support non-autoincrementing integer primary keys in MySQL

0.5.5 / 2012-06-20

* Enhancements

  * Remove lock_method stuff that really wasn't helping.

0.5.4 / 2012-05-08

* Enhancements

  * Slightly better way to get name of current database for locking purposes.

0.5.3 / 2012-04-24

* Enhancements

  * Cache name of the current database to speed things up.

0.5.2 / 2012-04-19

* Bug fixes

  * Fix indexes on multiple columns. Amazing how much damage a single #to_s can do.

0.5.1 / 2012-04-19

* Bug fixes

  * Fix require order... rookie mistake.

0.5.0 / 2012-04-19

* Known issues

  * Custom inheritance columns will be ignored unless you have activerecord >3.2.3 (unreleased as of this writing). The bug is https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/5327

* Breaking changes

  * the block form (schema {}) is removed
  * .col only accepts one column at a time
  * .col no longer accepts :as => :references
      was: col :group, :as => :references
      now: col :group_id, :type => :integer
  * .col no longer accepts :index => true
      was: col :foo, :index => true
      now: col :foo and then add_index :foo
  * A whole bunch of class methods are no longer mixed into ActiveRecord::Base (see Enhancements below)

* Enhancements

  * Database connection no longer needs to be established before you define columns/indexes (but of course you have to connect before you auto_upgrade!)
  * Only adds four (4) class methods to ActiveRecord::Base: .auto_upgrade!, .col, .add_index, and .inline_schema_config
  * Tested on MRI 1.8, MRI 1.9, and JRuby 1.6.7+ across mysql, postgresql, and sqlite3
  * Simply and DRY via a big refactor

## Difference between mini_record v0.2.1 and active_record_inline_schema v0.4.0

Having diverged at [this commit](https://github.com/DAddYE/mini_record/commit/55b2545f9772f7500d3782ac530b3da456f50023), I did stuff like...

* didn't set primary key on table definition
* allow custom column types
* removed aliases
* shorten name with zlib trick
* allow passing create_table_options
* default to ENGINE=InnoDB on mysql
* detect and create table for non-standard primary key
* move where schema inheritance columns are defined
* removed table_definition accessor
* allow custom column types like `varbinary`
* more compatible with ActiveRecord 3.0 and 3.2.2

## Difference between mini_record v0.2.1 and mini_record v0.3.0 (which I didn't fork)

After I made this list, I decided to diverge from mini_record v0.2.1 instead of doing a pull request:

* allow custom column types
* add timestamps
* remove unused (unmentioned) tables
* call auto_upgrade on descendant tables
* automagically generate fields from associations
* revised difference checking code

Pity the forker (me)!
